        <p class ="timeline-text">🇧🇷 🐣</p>
        <h3 class ="timeline-text">2013</h3>
        <p class ="timeline-text">started my studies to become an Electrical Engineer at the University of São Paulo</p>
        <h3 class ="timeline-text">2015</h3>
        <p class ="timeline-text">as a volunteer at CISV, had the opportunity to lead the brazilian delegation to Linz, Austria 🇦🇹, and </p>
        <h3 class ="timeline-text">2016</h3>
        <p class ="timeline-text">changed paths and started studying public relations, also at the University of São Paulo</p>
        <h3 class ="timeline-text">2018</h3>
        <p class ="timeline-text">got a job at LinkedIn as a Customer Success Management Intern and there I stayed until I was granted a scholarship to study a year abroad.<br>Moved to Newcastle, UK 🇬🇧, where I took modules on Entrepreneurship, Education in Emerging Countries and German 🇩🇪</p>
        <h3 class ="timeline-text">2020</h3>
        <p class ="timeline-text">back in Brazil 🇧🇷, I started working at Labenu, a startup that teaches people how to code and only charges them after they land a good job. That my current job and I've had a handful of roles so far. 
            Amongst those roles, I was one of the people responsible for the rebranding of the company and I've structured the employability program that is in place today. I've built a CRM to keep track of students development and also facilitated countless training sessions of Soft-Skills.  </p>
        <h3 class ="timeline-text">2021</h3>
        <p class ="timeline-text">to better help students to land great jobs, I've started learning how to code. Having a Full-time job and also dedicating four hours per day on the course is quite demanding. But fascinating.<br> When it comes to the technologies I've been learning, so far I can say that I can get by with Javascript, HTML and CSS. <br>My next step: React.</p>
